    <dt>The Conjuring</dt>
    <dd>is a fantastic next chapter in the franchise! It's got so much heart and a love story at its core. I got so invested that I forgot to eat dinner while watching the screener. No spoilers, but I slept with the light on.</dd>
    <dt>Second Chance</dt>
    <dd> i don't know why i choose this movie but i still remember when im young started to watch this with my mom and dad im only one child before and after start movie my mom and dad started to fight infront of me but when starts of movie i don't know why but i saw in my two eyes dad hold hands my mom that's why i choose and i recommend for you SECOND CHANCE</dd>
    <dt>Jumanjing</dt>
    <dd>Jumanjing is one of my favorite movie when im young reason, Jumanjing have a play and laugh movie and ofcourse i enjoyed to watch this.</dd>
    <dt>Venom</dt>
    <dd>I completely forgot The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom, and The Sinister Six we’re in development at the same time. Which is why we see the Venom symbiote in the trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which was later cut from the movie. I really would’ve liked to see this pan out.</dd>
    <dt>Lucid Dream</dt>
    <dd>it’s kinda strange being aware of the astrological transits going on in your life in the present as opposed to looking back years ago & what occurred. Sometimes it feels like you’re watching a movie in progress that u have the script to— but with free will, so like a lucid dream</dd>
