            <h3>By William Ernest Henley</h3>
            <p class="pclass">Out of the night that covers me,
                Black as the pit from pole to pole,
                I thank whatever gods may be
                For my unconquerable soul.</p>

            <p class="pclass">In the fell clutch of circumstance
                I have not winced nor cried aloud.
                Under the bludgeonings of chance
                My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>

            <p class="pclass">
                Beyond this place of wrath and tears
                Looms but the Horror of the shade,
                And yet the menace of the years
                Finds and shall find me unafraid.
            </p>

            <p class="pclass pitalics">
                It matters not how strait the gate,
                How charged with punishments the scroll,
                I am the master of my fate,
                I am the captain of my soul.

            <h4>About the Author</h4>
            <p class="author_desc">
                Born in Gloucester, England, poet, editor, and critic William Ernest Henley was educated at Crypt Grammar School, where he studied with the poet T.E. Brown, and the University of St. Andrews. 
           His father was a struggling bookseller who died when Henley was a teenager. At age 12 Henley was diagnosed with tubercular arthritis that necessitated the amputation of one of his legs just below the knee; the other foot was saved only through a radical surgery performed by Joseph Lister. 
          As he healed in the infirmary, Henley began to write poems, including "<a href="#title" id="title">Invictus</a>", which concludes with the oft-referenced lines “I am the master of my fate; / I am the captain of my soul.” Henley’s poems often engage themes of inner strength and perseverance. 
          His numerous collections of poetry include A Book of Verses (1888), London Voluntaries (1893), and Hawthorn and Lavender (1899). Source: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-ernest-henley" target="_blank" class="source">POETRY FOUNDATION </a>
